# I thought all methods in Python Required self as an argument?
#   Uncertainty: Does this include the __init__ method?
#       Cause: Is the Init Method Special?

# def __init__(self):
#     pass

# def funcWithoutReturnStatement():
#     print("Print Statement In funcWithoutReturnStatement")

# print(funcWithoutReturnStatement())
# print(funcWithReturnStatement())



# Set
# mySet = {1,2,3,4,5}
# mySet.pop()
# print(mySet)
### Set popped from beginning/start?
### Statcks are supposed to Pop From End / Top of Stack
### Is the Top of a Stack the Beginning or the End of the Stack?

# # Tuple
# myTuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
# myTuple.pop()
# print(myTuple)
# ### Tuple has no Pop method.

# Observation: Did not know that Tuples could hold data of different types. Thanks.
# experimentalTuple = (2,'apple', 3.5)
# print(type(experimentalTuple))
# print(experimentalTuple)










# # List
# myList = [1,2,3,4,5]
# myList.pop()
# print(myList)
# ### Pop in List worked as Expected.
# ### Pop method of List Class removed the last/top element of the stack, as Expected.

## Reverse List
# myList = reversed([1,2,3,4,5])
# print(myList)

# print(list(range(10,1,-1)))
# print(list(range(10,1,-1)))
# print(list(reversed(range(10,1,-1))))

# print(list(reversed(range(1, 11))))
