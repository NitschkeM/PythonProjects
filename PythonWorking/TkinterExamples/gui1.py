# The Main Window in Visual Studio Code
#   Counts Upwards Downwards
#   It Counts Numbers Upwards - but does so visually downwards in the vertical direction - it does so in a Column
#       The First Column would be number - enumerating the code lines
#       The Second Column would be code lines - Lines meant for writing either Code or Comments
