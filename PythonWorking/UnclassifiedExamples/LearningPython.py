### Learning Python ###

# Objects:
    # Individuality
    # Multiple names can be bound to the same object
    # Multiple scopes can be bound to the same object
    


# Immutable Basic Types:
    # Numbers
    # Strings
    # Tuples


# Mutable Objects:
    # Lists
    # Dictionaries
    # Possibly other types


# Class definitions play some neat tricks with namespaces.

# A NameSpace is a mapping from names to objects.
    # Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python Dictionaries.
        # Normally not Noticable in any way except Performance
            # May Change in the Future

    # The important thing to know about namespaces is this:
        # There is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces;
        # Two different modules may both define a function Maximize() without confusion.
        # Users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.
