# If I imagine another developer reading the code:
#   What would he likely be most interessted in?
#   What would be the most helpful information to him/her? In general, general would be written like this. In Norwegian it would be written like: "Generell".
#       Developer: Printing number of increasing value is what the function does.
#       Developer: Calling itself is how the function does it.
#       Other: The idea that a function can call itself is more interesting than the idea of a function printing number of increasing value.

###     The Key/Essence Is This: Different People/Roles Can Look At The Same Thing And See Something Different.
###         Some Roles would say X, Y, Z is the more important feautures/aspects of an object/relationship/event        ObjectRelationshipEvent: ORE    ObjektForholdHendelse: OFH
###         Other Roles would say A, B, C are the most important features/aspects of an ORE.
###             To one role/person ABC is the most Relevant and Useful.
###             To another role XYZ are the most Relevant and Useful.

# From this experiment I Conclude:
# The maximum recursion depth for this python installation is likely to be about 967 layers deep.
# The maximum recursion depth for this python installation is likely to be about 999 or 1000 layers deep.

# I don't see the path/goal/objective of increasing the certainty of the guess.
# I don't see the path/goal/objective of increasing the likelihood of the guess being correct as worth the Cost/Investment, from a Cost-Benefit Evaluation.
# I don't see the path/goal/objective of increasing our faith in the correctness of the guess.
#   If I dont Know if my Guess is Correct or Not - what relationship am I to have to the information?
#   Since I dont Know if my Guess is Correct or Not - what relationship am I to have to the information?
#       I prefered Since to If because I have accepted the fact that I don't know for certain if the guess is correct or not.
#       If I don't know something for certain - then I don't know it.
