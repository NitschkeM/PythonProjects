How much can be known about an application before starting development?
    When does development start?
        What happens before it starts?
        What is the first step of development?
            What is the first thing that happens when development starts?
                Is it when the first line of code is written?
                Is it when the first character of code is written?
                Is it when the coding/development environment is opned on the computer?

When I describe code with diagrams and user stories it feels like/is a bigger commitment?
    This association can be understood:
        Perhaps the techniques of diagrams and user stories has not been used on smaller projects?
            Perhaps they have been used - but automatically/naturally - so we did not notice we were doing it?
                We did not see the activity we were doing through the lense of a particular technique.
                    Just did what was natural to do?
                        What felt good to do?
                        Intuition?
                    What I thought was useful to do in order to achieve/reach the goal.
