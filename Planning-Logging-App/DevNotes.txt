I dont know what the folder structure will look like in the future.
I dont know the culture/trends/standards/agreements/commonPatterns of Python Folder Structures.

Was the Creators/Inventors of the AM/PM Time Units? biased towards the Number 12?
    Did they favor the Number 12?
What other reason could there be for selecting the AM/PM scheme over the perhaps more obvious? 24 hour scheme?
Why 24 hours?
12 months in a year? --> AM/PM --> NVM, LOL --> 24 Hours?
